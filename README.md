This Java program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations using two integers. The operations performed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To run the program, ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. 
Save the code in a file named ArithmeticOperation.
java, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and compile the program using javac ArithmeticOperation.java. Then, run the compiled program with java ArithmeticOperation. 
The code initializes two integers, num1 and num2, with values 42 and 100, respectively.
It then calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient, printing the results to the console. 

The expected output is:
Sum: 142
Subtraction: -58
Multiply: 4200
Division: 0
Note that the division result is 0 because it uses integer division. To get a decimal result, you would need to use floating-point numbers such as double.

YOU CAN CHANGE THE NUM1, NUM2 to CHANGE THE OUTPUT.
